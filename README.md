## Welcome to Reassurance app!

This app was designed for people who have a hard time remembering that special verse in the Bible that made a lasting impression on them.

Use this app to record a bible verse and tag it with an associated emotion that this verse makes you feel or helps you to overcome. Once you havecreated a verse and tagged it with an emotion you can always return to the app and filter based on an emotion to find those verses that helped you in the past. Also add comments to each individual verse to help you remember something special about it.
